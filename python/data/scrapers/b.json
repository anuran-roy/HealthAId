        "Overview": "Acute coronary syndrome is a term that describes a range of conditions related to sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart. These conditions include a heart attack and unstable angina.\n\nA heart attack happens when cell death damages or destroys heart tissue. A heart attack also is known as a myocardial infarction.\n\nUnstable angina occurs when blood flow to the heart decreases. It's not severe enough to cause cell death or a heart attack. But the reduced blood flow may increase your risk of a heart attack.\n\nAcute coronary syndrome often causes severe chest pain or discomfort. It is a medical emergency that needs a diagnosis and care right away. The goals of treatment include improving blood flow, treating complications and preventing future problems.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of acute coronary syndrome usually begin suddenly. They include:\n\nChest pain or discomfort. This is often described as aching, pressure, tightness or burning. Chest pain also is called angina.\n\nPain that starts in the chest and spreads to other parts of the body. These areas include the shoulders, arms, upper belly area, back, neck or jaw.\n\nNausea or vomiting.\n\nIndigestion.\n\nShortness of breath, also called dyspnea.\n\nSudden, heavy sweating.\n\nRacing heartbeat.\n\nFeeling lightheaded or dizzy.\n\nFainting.\n\nUnusual fatigue.\n\nChest pain or discomfort is the most common symptom. But symptoms may vary quite a bit depending on your age, sex and other medical conditions. You're more likely to have symptoms without chest pain or discomfort if you're a woman, an older adult or have diabetes.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nAcute coronary syndrome is a medical emergency. Chest pain or discomfort can be a symptom of many life-threatening conditions. Get emergency help for a diagnosis and appropriate care right away. Do not drive yourself to the hospital.\n\nRequest an appointment",
        "Causes": "Acute coronary syndrome usually results from the buildup of fatty deposits on the walls of blood vessels that deliver blood, oxygen and nutrients to heart muscles. Fatty deposits also are called plaque. The blood vessels that supply the heart also are known as coronary arteries.\n\nWhen a fatty deposit ruptures or splits, a blood clot forms. This clot blocks the flow of blood to heart muscles.\n\nWhen the supply of oxygen to cells is too low, cells in the heart muscles can die. The death of cells results in damage to muscle tissues. This is called a heart attack.\n\nEven when there is no cell death, the drop in oxygen still results in heart muscles that don't work the way they should. This change may be short-lived or permanent. When acute coronary syndrome doesn't result in cell death, it is called unstable angina.",
        "Risk factors": "The risk factors for acute coronary syndrome are the same as those for other types of heart disease. Risk factors include:\n\nGetting older.\n\nHigh blood pressure.\n\nHigh blood cholesterol.\n\nSmoking tobacco.\n\nLack of physical activity.\n\nEating an unhealthy diet.\n\nObesity or overweight.\n\nDiabetes.\n\nPersonal or family history of chest pain, heart attacks or stroke.\n\nHistory of high blood pressure, preeclampsia or diabetes during pregnancy, and early menopause.\n\nCOVID-19\n\ninfection.",

        "Overview": "Acute liver failure is loss of liver function that occurs quickly \u2014 in days or weeks \u2014 usually in a person who has no preexisting liver disease. It's most commonly caused by a hepatitis virus or drugs, such as acetaminophen. Acute liver failure is less common than chronic liver failure, which develops more slowly.\n\nAcute liver failure, also known as fulminant hepatic failure, can cause serious complications, including bleeding and increased pressure in the brain. It's a medical emergency that requires hospitalization.\n\nDepending on the cause, acute liver failure can sometimes be reversed with treatment. In many situations, though, a liver transplant may be the only cure.\n\nProducts & Services\n\nBook: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition\n\nNewsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter \u2014 Digital Edition\n\nShow more products from Mayo Clinic",

        "Causes": "Acute liver failure occurs when liver cells are damaged significantly and are no longer able to function. Potential causes include:\n\nAcetaminophen overdose.\n\nTaking too much acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States. Outside of the United States, acetaminophen is known as paracetamol. Acute liver failure can occur after one very large dose of acetaminophen, or after higher than recommended doses every day for several days.\n\nIf you or someone you know has taken an overdose of acetaminophen, seek medical attention as quickly as possible. Treatment may prevent liver failure. Don't wait for the signs of liver failure.\n\nPrescription medications.\n\nSome prescription medications, including antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anticonvulsants, can cause acute liver failure.\n\nHerbal supplements.\n\nHerbal drugs and supplements, including kava, ephedra, skullcap and pennyroyal, have been linked to acute liver failure.\n\nHepatitis and other viruses.\n\nHepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis E can cause acute liver failure. Other viruses that can cause acute liver failure include Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus.\n\nToxins.\n\nToxins that can cause acute liver failure include the poisonous wild mushroom Amanita phalloides, which is sometimes mistaken for one that is safe to eat. Carbon tetrachloride is another toxin that can cause acute liver failure. It is an industrial chemical found in refrigerants and solvents for waxes, varnishes and other materials.\n\nAutoimmune disease.\n\nLiver failure can be caused by autoimmune hepatitis \u2014 a disease in which your immune system attacks liver cells, causing inflammation and injury.\n\nDiseases of the veins in the liver.\n\nVascular diseases, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, can cause blockages in the veins of the liver and lead to acute liver failure.\n\nMetabolic disease.\n\nRare metabolic diseases, such as Wilson's disease and acute fatty liver of pregnancy, infrequently cause acute liver failure.\n\nCancer.\n\nCancer that either begins in or spreads to your liver can cause your liver to fail.\n\nShock.\n\nOverwhelming infection (sepsis) and shock can severely reduce blood flow to the liver, causing liver failure.\n\nHeat stroke.\n\nExtreme physical activity in a hot environment can trigger acute liver failure.\n\nSome cases of acute liver failure have no obvious cause.",
        "Complications": "Acute liver failure often causes complications, including:\n\nToo much fluid in the brain (cerebral edema).\n\nToo much fluid causes pressure to build up in your brain, which can lead to disorientation, severe mental confusion and seizures.\n\nBleeding and bleeding disorders.\n\nA failing liver cannot make enough clotting factors, which help blood to clot. Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is common with this condition. It may be difficult to control.\n\nInfections.\n\nPeople with acute liver failure are more likely to develop infections, particularly in the blood and in the respiratory and urinary tracts.\n\nKidney failure.\n\nKidney failure often occurs after liver failure, especially if you had an acetaminophen overdose, which damages both your liver and your kidneys.",
        "Prevention": "Reduce your risk of acute liver failure by taking care of your liver.\n\nFollow instructions on medications.\n\nIf you take acetaminophen or other medications, check the package insert for the recommended dosage, and don't take more than that. If you already have liver disease, ask your health care provider if it is safe to take any amount of acetaminophen.\n\nTell your provider about all your medicines.\n\nEven over-the-counter and herbal medicines can interfere with prescription drugs you're taking.\n\nDrink alcohol in moderation, if at all.\n\nIf you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.\n\nAvoid risky behavior.\n\nGet help if you use illicit intravenous drugs. Don't share needles. Use condoms during sex. If you get tattoos or body piercings, make sure the shop you choose is clean and safe. Don't smoke.\n\nGet vaccinated.\n\nIf you have chronic liver disease, a history of any type of hepatitis infection or an increased risk of hepatitis, talk to your provider about getting the hepatitis B vaccine. A vaccine also is available for hepatitis A.\n\nAvoid contact with other people's blood and body fluids.\n\nAccidental needle sticks or improper cleanup of blood or body fluids can spread hepatitis viruses. Sharing razor blades or toothbrushes also can spread infection.\n\nDon't eat wild mushrooms.\n\nIt can be difficult to tell the difference between a poisonous mushroom and one that is safe to eat.\n\nTake care with aerosol sprays.\n\nWhen you use an aerosol cleaner, make sure the room is ventilated, or wear a mask. Take similar protective measures when spraying insecticides, fungicides, paint and other toxic chemicals. Follow product instructions carefully.\n\nWatch what gets on your skin.\n\nWhen using insecticides and other toxic chemicals, cover your skin with gloves, long sleeves, a hat and a mask.\n\nMaintain a healthy weight.\n\nObesity can cause a condition called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which may include fatty liver, hepatitis and cirrhosis.",

        "Causes": "Adrenal glands\n\nEnlarge image\n\nClose\n\nAdrenal glands\n\nAdrenal glands\n\nLocated on top of each kidney, the adrenal glands make hormones that help regulate metabolism, the immune system, blood pressure and other important functions. Although small, these glands control much of what happens in the body.\n\nAddison's disease is caused by damage to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands sit just above the kidneys. As part of the endocrine system, they make hormones that affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Damage to these glands results in too little of the hormone cortisol and, often, the hormone aldosterone.\n\nThe adrenal glands are made up of two sections. The interior, called the medulla, makes adrenaline-like hormones. The outer layer, called the cortex, makes a group of hormones called corticosteroids. Corticosteroids include:\n\nGlucocorticoids.\n\nThese hormones, including cortisol, affect the body's ability to turn food into energy. They also play a role in the immune system's inflammatory response and help the body respond to stress.\n\nMineralocorticoids.\n\nThese hormones, including aldosterone, balance the body's sodium and potassium to keep blood pressure in a healthy range.\n\nAndrogens.\n\nIn all people, the adrenal glands make small amounts of these sex hormones. They cause male sexual development. And they affect muscle mass, sex drive, known as libido, and a sense of well-being in all people.\n\nPrimary adrenal insufficiency\n\nSometimes, the outer layer of the adrenal glands, known as the cortex, is damaged. Then it can't make enough hormones, a condition called primary adrenal insufficiency. This is usually the result of an autoimmune disease, in which the body attacks itself. People with Addison's disease are more likely than are other people to have another autoimmune disease as well.\n\nOther causes of adrenal gland failure may include:\n\nTuberculosis\n\nOther infections of the adrenal glands\n\nSpread of cancer to the adrenal glands\n\nBleeding into the adrenal glands\n\nSecondary adrenal insufficiency\n\nThe pituitary gland makes a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).\n\nACTH\n\nin turn causes the adrenal cortex to make its hormones. Having pituitary tumors that aren't cancer, inflammation and pituitary surgery can cause the pituitary gland to make too little\n\nACTH\n\n.\n\nToo little\n\nACTH\n\ncan cause the adrenal glands to make too little glucocorticoids and androgens. This is called secondary adrenal insufficiency.\n\nMost symptoms of secondary adrenal insufficiency are similar to those of primary adrenal insufficiency. However, people with secondary adrenal insufficiency don't have darkened skin and are less likely to have severe dehydration or low blood pressure. They're more likely to have low blood sugar.\n\nA temporary cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when people who take corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to treat conditions such as asthma or arthritis, stop taking the medicine suddenly rather than tapering off.",
        "Complications": "Addisonian crisis.\n\nIf you have untreated Addison's disease, you may develop an addisonian crisis as a result of stress on the body, such as injury, infection or illness. Typically, the adrenal glands make two or three times the usual amount of cortisol in response to physical stress. With adrenal insufficiency, not being able to increase the amount of cortisol made as a result of stress can lead to an addisonian crisis.\n\nAn addisonian crisis is a life-threatening situation that results in low blood pressure, low blood levels of sugar and high blood levels of potassium. It requires immediate medical care.\n\nOther autoimmune diseases.\n\nPeople with Addison's disease often have related autoimmune diseases.",
        "Prevention": "Addison's disease can't be prevented, but there are ways to avoid an addisonian crisis:\n\nTalk to your health care provider if you always feel tired or weak or are losing weight without trying. Ask about an adrenal shortage.\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with Addison's disease, ask your provider what to do when you're sick. You may need to learn how to increase your dose of corticosteroids.\n\nIf you become very sick, especially if you are vomiting and you can't take your medicine, go to an emergency room.\n\nSome people with Addison's disease worry about serious side effects from hydrocortisone or prednisone. However, people with Addison's disease aren't as likely to get the side effects of high-dose glucocorticoids. That's because the dose prescribed replaces the amount that's missing.\n\nIf you take cortisone, be sure to follow up with your provider regularly to make sure your dose is not too high.",

        "Overview": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic condition that affects millions of children and often continues into adulthood.\n\nADHD\n\nincludes a combination of persistent problems, such as difficulty sustaining attention, hyperactivity and impulsive behavior.\n\nChildren with\n\nADHD\n\nmay also struggle with low self-esteem, troubled relationships and poor performance in school. Symptoms sometimes lessen with age. However, some people never completely outgrow their\n\nADHD\n\nsymptoms. But they can learn strategies to be successful.\n\nWhile treatment won't cure\n\nADHD\n\n, it can help a great deal with symptoms. Treatment typically involves medications and behavioral interventions. Early diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in outcome.\n\nProducts & Services\n\nBook: Mayo Clinic Guide to Raising a Healthy Child",
        "Symptoms": "The primary features of\n\nADHD\n\ninclude inattention and hyperactive-impulsive behavior.\n\nADHD\n\nsymptoms start before age 12, and in some children, they're noticeable as early as 3 years of age.\n\nADHD\n\nsymptoms can be mild, moderate or severe, and they may continue into adulthood.\n\nADHD\n\noccurs more often in males than in females, and behaviors can be different in boys and girls. For example, boys may be more hyperactive and girls may tend to be quietly inattentive.\n\nThere are three subtypes of\n\nADHD\n\n:\n\nPredominantly inattentive.\n\nThe majority of symptoms fall under inattention.\n\nPredominantly hyperactive/impulsive.\n\nThe majority of symptoms are hyperactive and impulsive.\n\nCombined.\n\nThis is a mix of inattentive symptoms and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms.\n\nInattention\n\nA child who shows a pattern of inattention may often:\n\nFail to pay close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork\n\nHave trouble staying focused in tasks or play\n\nAppear not to listen, even when spoken to directly\n\nHave difficulty following through on instructions and fail to finish schoolwork or chores\n\nHave trouble organizing tasks and activities\n\nAvoid or dislike tasks that require focused mental effort, such as homework\n\nLose items needed for tasks or activities, for example, toys, school assignments, pencils\n\nBe easily distracted\n\nForget to do some daily activities, such as forgetting to do chores\n\nHyperactivity and impulsivity\n\nA child who shows a pattern of hyperactive and impulsive symptoms may often:\n\nFidget with or tap his or her hands or feet, or squirm in the seat\n\nHave difficulty staying seated in the classroom or in other situations\n\nBe on the go, in constant motion\n\nRun around or climb in situations when it's not appropriate\n\nHave trouble playing or doing an activity quietly\n\nTalk too much\n\nBlurt out answers, interrupting the questioner\n\nHave difficulty waiting for his or her turn\n\nInterrupt or intrude on others' conversations, games or activities\n\nTypical developmental behavior vs. ADHD\n\nMost healthy children are inattentive, hyperactive or impulsive at one time or another. It's typical for preschoolers to have short attention spans and be unable to stick with one activity for long. Even in older children and teenagers, attention span often depends on the level of interest.\n\nThe same is true of hyperactivity. Young children are naturally energetic \u2014 they often are still full of energy long after they've worn their parents out. In addition, some children just naturally have a higher activity level than others do. Children should never be classified as having\n\nADHD\n\njust because they're different from their friends or siblings.\n\nChildren who have problems in school but get along well at home or with friends are likely struggling with something other than\n\nADHD\n\n. The same is true of children who are hyperactive or inattentive at home, but whose schoolwork and friendships remain unaffected.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nIf you're concerned that your child shows signs of\n\nADHD\n\n, see your pediatrician or family doctor. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, such as a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, psychologist, psychiatrist or pediatric neurologist, but it's important to have a medical evaluation first to check for other possible causes of your child's difficulties.\n\nRequest an appointment\n\nThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

The reaction to a stressful change or event is much more intense than would typically be expected. This can cause a lot of problems in getting along with others, as well as at work or school.\n\nWork problems, going away to school, an illness or any number of life changes can cause stress.

But if you have an adjustment disorder, you continue to have emotional or behavioral responses that can make you feel more anxious or depressed.\n\nTreatment can help you regain your emotional well-being.\n\nProducts & Services\n\nBook: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition\n\nNewsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter \u2014 Digital Edition\n\nShow more products from Mayo Clinic",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms depend on the type of adjustment disorder. These symptoms can vary from person to person. You experience more stress than would generally be expected in response to a trying event, and this stress causes a lot of problems in your life.\n\nAdjustment disorders affect how you feel and think about yourself and the world. They also may affect your actions or behavior.\n\nSome examples include:\n\nFeeling sad, hopeless or not enjoying things you used to enjoy.\n\nCrying often.\n\nWorrying, or feeling anxious, nervous, jittery or stressed out.\n\nFeeling irritable or like you can't handle anything and don't know where to start.\n\nHaving trouble sleeping.\n\nNot eating enough.\n\nHaving difficulty concentrating.\n\nHaving difficulty with daily activities.\n\nWithdrawing from family and friends who support you socially.\n\nNot doing important things, such as going to work or paying bills.\n\nThinking about suicide or acting on those thoughts.\n\nSymptoms of an adjustment disorder start within three months of a stressful event. These symptoms last no longer than six months after the end of the stressful event. But constant or lasting adjustment disorders can continue for more than six months. This is especially true if the stressful event is ongoing, such as being unemployed.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nStressors are usually temporary. You learn to cope with them over time. Symptoms of adjustment disorder usually get better when the stress eases. But sometimes the stressful event continues to be a part of your life. Or a new stressful situation comes up, and you face the same emotional struggles all over again.\n\nTalk to your doctor or a mental health professional if you continue to struggle or if you're having trouble getting through each day. You can get treatment to help you cope better with stressful events and feel better about life again.\n\nIf you have concerns about your child's behavior, talk with your child's doctor.\n\nSuicidal thoughts or behavior\n\nThe risk of suicide can be higher in people who have adjustment disorders. If you're thinking about suicide, contact a hotline for counseling:\n\nIn the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the\n\n988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\n\n. It's available 24 hours a day, every day.

If your difficulties are recent or occurred only occasionally in the past, you probably don't have\n\nADHD\n\n.\n\nADHD\n\nis diagnosed only when symptoms are severe enough to cause ongoing problems in more than one area of your life. These persistent and disruptive symptoms can be traced back to early childhood.\n\nDiagnosis of\n\nADHD\n\nin adults can be difficult because certain\n\nADHD\n\nsymptoms are similar to those caused by other conditions, such as anxiety or mood disorders. And many adults with\n\nADHD\n\nalso have at least one other mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nIf any of the symptoms listed above continually disrupt your life, talk to your doctor about whether you might have\n\nADHD\n\n.\n\nDifferent types of health care professionals may diagnose and supervise treatment for\n\nADHD\n\n.

Congenital heart disease in adults and children can change the way blood flows through the heart.\n\nThere are many different types of congenital heart defects. This article focuses on congenital heart disease in adults.\n\nSome types of congenital heart disease may be mild. But complex defects may cause life-threatening complications. However, advances in diagnosis and treatment continue to improve survival for those with congenital heart disease.\n\nPeople with congenital heart disease need lifelong medical care. Treatment may include regular checkups (watchful waiting), medications or surgery. If you have adult congenital heart disease, ask your health care provider how often you need a checkup.\n\nProducts & Services\n\nBook: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition\n\nNewsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter \u2014 Digital Edition\n\nShow more products from Mayo Clinic",

        "Symptoms": "For some people, signs or symptoms of congenital heart disease aren't noticed until adulthood. Symptoms may return years after a congenital heart defect is treated.\n\nCommon congenital heart disease symptoms in adults include:\n\nIrregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\n\nBlue skin, lips and fingernails (cyanosis)\n\nShortness of breath\n\nFeeling tired very quickly with activity\n\nSwelling of body tissue or organs (edema)\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nIf you're having worrisome symptoms, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, seek emergency medical attention.\n\nIf you have signs or symptoms of congenital heart disease or were treated for a congenital heart defect as a child, make an appointment to see your health care provider.\n\nRequest an appointment",
        "Causes": "Chambers and valves of the heart\n\nEnlarge image\n\nClose\n\nChambers and valves of the heart\n\nChambers and valves of the heart\n\nA typical heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.\n\nResearchers aren't sure what causes most types of congenital heart disease. Some congenital heart diseases are passed down through families (inherited).\n\nTo understand congenital heart disease, it helps to know how the heart typically works.\n\nThe heart is divided into chambers \u2014 two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).\n\nThe right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through blood vessels (pulmonary arteries).\n\nIn the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and then returns to the left side of your heart through the pulmonary veins.\n\nThe left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the aorta and out to the rest of the body.\n\nCongenital heart disease can affect any of these heart structures, including the arteries, valves, chambers and the wall of tissue that separates the chambers (septum).",
        "Risk factors": "Certain environmental and genetic risk factors might play a role in the development of congenital heart disease, including:\n\nGenetics.\n\nCongenital heart disease appears to run in families (inherited). It's associated with many genetic syndromes. For instance, children with Down syndrome often have congenital heart defects. Genetic testing can detect Down syndrome and some other genetic conditions while a baby is still in the mother's womb.\n\nGerman measles (rubella).\n\nHaving rubella during pregnancy may affect how the baby's heart develops while in the womb.\n\nDiabetes.\n\nHaving type 1 or type 2 diabetes during pregnancy also may affect a baby's heart development. Gestational diabetes generally doesn't increase the risk of congenital heart disease.\n\nMedications.\n\nTaking certain medications while pregnant can cause congenital heart disease and other birth defects. Medications linked to heart defects include lithium for bipolar disorder and isotretinoin (Claravis, Myorisan, others), which is used to treat acne. Always tell your health care provider about the medications you take.\n\nAlcohol.\n\nDrinking alcohol while pregnant has been linked to an increased risk of heart defects in the baby.\n\nSmoking.\n\nIf you smoke, quit. Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital heart defects in the baby.",
        "Complications": "Congenital heart disease can contribute to other health concerns later in life. Complications may occur years after a congenital heart defect is treated.\n\nComplications of congenital heart disease in adults include:\n\nIrregular heartbeats (arrhythmias).\n\nFaulty heart signaling causes the heart to beat too fast, too slowly or irregularly. In some people, severe arrhythmias may cause stroke or sudden cardiac death if not treated. Scar tissue in the heart from previous surgeries can contribute to this complication.\n\nHeart infection (endocarditis).\n\nBacteria or other germs can enter the bloodstream and move to the inner lining of the heart (endocardium). Untreated, this infection can damage or destroy the heart valves or cause a stroke. If you are at high risk of endocarditis, your care provider may recommend taking antibiotics one hour before dental cleanings. Regular dental checkups are important. Healthy gums and teeth reduce the risk that bacteria will enter the bloodstream.\n\nStroke.\n\nA congenital heart defect can allow a blood clot to pass through the heart and travel to the brain, where it reduces or blocks blood supply.\n\nHigh blood pressure in the lung arteries (pulmonary hypertension).\n\nSome congenital heart defects send more blood to the lungs, causing pressure to build. This eventually causes the heart muscle to weaken and sometimes to fail.\n\nHeart failure.\n\nHeart failure (congestive heart failure) means the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\nAdult congenital heart disease and pregnancy\n\nIt may be possible to have a successful pregnancy with mild congenital heart disease. A care provider may tell you not to get pregnant if you have a complex congenital heart defect.\n\nBefore becoming pregnant, talk to your health care provider about the possible risks and complications. Together you can discuss and plan for any special care needed during pregnancy.",
        "Prevention": "Some types of congenital heart disease occur in families (inherited). If you have or someone in your family has congenital heart disease, screening by a genetic counselor may help determine the risk of certain heart defects in future children.",

        "Overview": "Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder. Agoraphobia involves fearing and avoiding places or situations that might cause panic and feelings of being trapped, helpless or embarrassed. You may fear an actual or upcoming situation. For example, you may fear using public transportation, being in open or enclosed spaces, standing in line, or being in a crowd.\n\nThe anxiety is caused by fear that there's no easy way to escape or get help if the anxiety gets overwhelming. You may avoid situations because of fears such as getting lost, falling, or having diarrhea and not being able to get to a bathroom. Most people who have agoraphobia develop it after having one or more panic attacks, causing them to worry about having another attack. They then avoid the places where it may happen again.\n\nAgoraphobia often results in having a hard time feeling safe in any public place, especially where crowds gather and in locations that are not familiar. You may feel that you need a companion, such as a family member or friend, to go with you to public places. The fear can be so overwhelming that you may feel you can't leave your home.\n\nAgoraphobia treatment can be challenging because it means confronting your fears. But with proper treatment \u2014 usually a form of therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy and medicines \u2014 you can escape the trap of agoraphobia and live a more enjoyable life.\n\nProducts & Services\n\nAssortment of Health Products from Mayo Clinic Store\n\nBook: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition\n\nNewsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter \u2014 Digital Edition\n\nShow more products from Mayo Clinic",

Or you may fear having other disabling or embarrassing symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, falling or diarrhea.\n\nIn addition:\n\nYour fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger of the situation.\n\nYou avoid the situation, you need a companion to go with you, or you endure the situation but are extremely upset.\n\nYou have major distress or problems with social situations, work or other areas in your life because of the fear, anxiety or avoidance.\n\nYour fear and avoidance usually lasts six months or longer.\n\nPanic disorder and agoraphobia\n\nSome people have panic disorder in addition to agoraphobia. Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder that includes panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden feeling of extreme fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes and triggers a variety of intense physical symptoms. You might think that you're totally losing control, having a heart attack or even dying.\n\nFear of another panic attack can lead to avoiding similar situations or the place where it happened in an attempt to prevent future panic attacks.\n\nSymptoms of a panic attack can include:\n\nRapid heart rate.\n\nTrouble breathing or a feeling of choking.\n\nChest pain or pressure.\n\nLightheadedness or dizziness.\n\nFeeling shaky, numb or tingling.\n\nSweating too much.\n\nSudden flushing or chills.\n\nUpset stomach or diarrhea.\n\nFeeling a loss of control.\n\nFear of dying.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nAgoraphobia can severely limit your ability to socialize, work, attend important events and even manage the details of daily life, such as running errands.\n\nDon't let agoraphobia make your world smaller.

        "Overview": "The term albinism usually refers to oculocutaneous (ok-u-low-ku-TAY-nee-us) albinism (OCA).\n\nOCA\n\nis a group of disorders passed down in families where the body makes little or none of a substance called melanin. The type and amount of melanin in your body determines the color of your skin, hair and eyes. Melanin also plays a role in the development and function of the eyes, so people with albinism have vision problems.\n\nSymptoms of albinism are usually seen in a person's skin, hair and eye color, but sometimes differences are slight. People with albinism are also sensitive to the effects of the sun, so they're at higher risk of getting skin cancer.\n\nAlthough there's no cure for albinism, people with the disorder can take steps to protect their skin and eyes and get proper eye and skin care.\n\nProducts & Services\n\nBook: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition\n\nNewsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter \u2014 Digital Edition\n\nShow more products from Mayo Clinic",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision.\n\nSkin\n\nThe easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism.\n\nWith exposure to the sun, some people may develop:\n\nFreckles.\n\nMoles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink.\n\nLarge freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez).\n\nSunburn and no ability to tan.\n\nFor some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color.\n\nHair\n\nHair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age.\n\nEye color\n\nEyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age.\n\nWith albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting.\n\nVision\n\nVision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include:\n\nRapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus.\n\nAn uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better.\n\nEyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus.\n\nProblems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness.\n\nExtreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia.\n\nA difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision.\n\nDifferences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision.\n\nNerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve.\n\nPoor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is.\n\nLegal blindness \u2014 vision less than 20/200 \u2014 or complete blindness.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nAt your child's birth, the health care provider may notice a lack of color in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows. The provider will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your child's skin color and vision.\n\nIf you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your health care provider.\n\nContact your health care provider if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising or long-term infections. These symptoms may suggest rare but serious hereditary conditions that include albinism.\n\nRequest an appointment",
        "Causes": "Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern\n\nEnlarge image\n\nClose\n\nAutosomal recessive inheritance pattern\n\nAutosomal recessive inheritance pattern\n\nTo have an autosomal recessive disorder, you inherit two changed genes, sometimes called mutations. You get one from each parent. Their health is rarely affected because they have only one changed gene. Two carriers have a 25% chance of having an unaffected child with two unaffected genes. They have a 50% chance of having an unaffected child who also is a carrier. They have a 25% chance of having an affected child with two changed genes.\n\nSeveral genes give instructions for making one of several proteins involved in producing melanin. Melanin is made by cells called melanocytes that are found in your skin, hair and eyes.\n\nAlbinism is caused by a change in one of these genes. Different types of albinism can occur, based mainly on which gene change caused the disorder. The gene change may result in no melanin at all or a big decrease in the amount of melanin.\n\nTypes of albinism\n\nTypes of albinism are grouped based on how they're passed down in families and on the gene that is affected.\n\nOculocutaneous albinism (OCA),\n\nthe most common type, means a person gets two copies of a changed gene \u2014 one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance.\n\nOCA\n\nis the result of a change in one of eight genes, labeled from\n\nOCA1\n\nto\n\nOCA8\n\n.\n\nOCA\n\ncauses decreased pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, as well as vision problems. The amount of pigment varies by type. The resulting color of skin, hair and eyes also varies by and within types.\n\nOcular albinism\n\nis mainly limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of ocular albinism is type 1. This type is passed down by a gene change on the X chromosome. X-linked ocular albinism can be passed on by a mother who carries one changed X gene to her son. This is called X-linked recessive inheritance. Ocular albinism usually occurs only in males. It's much less common than\n\nOCA\n\n.\n\nAlbinism related to rare hereditary syndromes\n\ncan occur. For example, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome includes a form of\n\nOCA\n\n, as well as bleeding and bruising problems and lung and bowel diseases. Chediak-Higashi syndrome includes a form of\n\nOCA\n\n, as well as immune problems with recurrent infections, problems with the brain and nerves, bleeding disorders, and other serious issues.",
        "Complications": "Albinism can include skin and eye complications. It also can include social and emotional challenges.\n\nEye complications\n\nProblems with vision can impact learning, employment and the ability to drive.\n\nSkin complications\n\nPeople with albinism have skin that is very sensitive to light and sun. Sunburn is one of the most serious complications of albinism. Sun exposure can cause sun damage, which may result in rough and thickened skin. Sunburn also can increase the risk of developing skin cancer.\n\nBecause of the lack of skin pigment, a type of skin cancer called melanoma may appear as pink or red growths or moles, rather than the usual black or brown color. This can make skin cancer harder to identify at an early stage. Without careful and regular skin exams, melanoma may not be diagnosed until it's advanced.\n\nSocial and emotional challenges\n\nSome people with albinism may experience discrimination. The reactions of other people to those with albinism can have a negative impact on people with the condition.\n\nPeople with albinism may experience bullying, teasing or unwanted questions about their appearance, eyewear or visual aid tools. They may look different from members of their own families or ethnic groups, so they may feel like outsiders or be treated like outsiders. These experiences may cause social isolation, poor self-esteem and stress.\n\nUsing the term \"person with albinism\" is preferred to avoid the negative impact of other terms.",
        "Prevention": "If a family member has albinism, a genetic counselor can help you understand the type of albinism and the chances of having a future child with albinism. The counselor can explain the available genetic tests.",
