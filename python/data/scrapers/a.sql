INSERT INTO mytable(Overview,Symptoms,Causes,Risk_factors,Related,Name,Complications,Prevention,Types) VALUES ('Acute coronary syndrome is a term that describes a range of conditions related to sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart. These conditions include a heart attack and unstable angina.

A heart attack happens when cell death damages or destroys heart tissue. A heart attack also is known as a myocardial infarction.

Unstable angina occurs when blood flow to the heart decreases. It''s not severe enough to cause cell death or a heart attack. But the reduced blood flow may increase your risk of a heart attack.

Acute coronary syndrome often causes severe chest pain or discomfort. It is a medical emergency that needs a diagnosis and care right away. The goals of treatment include improving blood flow, treating complications and preventing future problems.','The symptoms of acute coronary syndrome usually begin suddenly. They include:

Chest pain or discomfort. This is often described as aching, pressure, tightness or burning. Chest pain also is called angina.

Pain that starts in the chest and spreads to other parts of the body. These areas include the shoulders, arms, upper belly area, back, neck or jaw.

Nausea or vomiting.

Indigestion.

Shortness of breath, also called dyspnea.

Sudden, heavy sweating.

Racing heartbeat.

Feeling lightheaded or dizzy.

Fainting.

Unusual fatigue.

Chest pain or discomfort is the most common symptom. But symptoms may vary quite a bit depending on your age, sex and other medical conditions. You''re more likely to have symptoms without chest pain or discomfort if you''re a woman, an older adult or have diabetes.

When to see a doctor

Acute coronary syndrome is a medical emergency. Chest pain or discomfort can be a symptom of many life-threatening conditions. Get emergency help for a diagnosis and appropriate care right away. Do not drive yourself to the hospital.

Request an appointment','Acute coronary syndrome usually results from the buildup of fatty deposits on the walls of blood vessels that deliver blood, oxygen and nutrients to heart muscles. Fatty deposits also are called plaque. The blood vessels that supply the heart also are known as coronary arteries.

When a fatty deposit ruptures or splits, a blood clot forms. This clot blocks the flow of blood to heart muscles.

When the supply of oxygen to cells is too low, cells in the heart muscles can die. The death of cells results in damage to muscle tissues. This is called a heart attack.

Even when there is no cell death, the drop in oxygen still results in heart muscles that don''t work the way they should. This change may be short-lived or permanent. When acute coronary syndrome doesn''t result in cell death, it is called unstable angina.','The risk factors for acute coronary syndrome are the same as those for other types of heart disease. Risk factors include:

Getting older.

High blood pressure.

High blood cholesterol.

Smoking tobacco.

Lack of physical activity.

Eating an unhealthy diet.

Obesity or overweight.

Diabetes.

Personal or family history of chest pain, heart attacks or stroke.

History of high blood pressure, preeclampsia or diabetes during pregnancy, and early menopause.

It''s most commonly caused by a hepatitis virus or drugs, such as acetaminophen. Acute liver failure is less common than chronic liver failure, which develops more slowly.

Acute liver failure, also known as fulminant hepatic failure, can cause serious complications, including bleeding and increased pressure in the brain. It''s a medical emergency that requires hospitalization.

Depending on the cause, acute liver failure can sometimes be reversed with treatment. In many situations, though, a liver transplant may be the only cure.

Retry','Acute liver failure occurs when liver cells are damaged significantly and are no longer able to function. Potential causes include:

Acetaminophen overdose.

Taking too much acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States. Outside of the United States, acetaminophen is known as paracetamol. Acute liver failure can occur after one very large dose of acetaminophen, or after higher than recommended doses every day for several days.

If you or someone you know has taken an overdose of acetaminophen, seek medical attention as quickly as possible. Treatment may prevent liver failure. Don''t wait for the signs of liver failure.

Prescription medications.

Some prescription medications, including antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anticonvulsants, can cause acute liver failure.

Herbal supplements.

Herbal drugs and supplements, including kava, ephedra, skullcap and pennyroyal, have been linked to acute liver failure.

Hepatitis and other viruses.

Hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis E can cause acute liver failure. Other viruses that can cause acute liver failure include Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus.

Toxins.

Toxins that can cause acute liver failure include the poisonous wild mushroom Amanita phalloides, which is sometimes mistaken for one that is safe to eat. Carbon tetrachloride is another toxin that can cause acute liver failure. It is an industrial chemical found in refrigerants and solvents for waxes, varnishes and other materials.

Autoimmune disease.

Liver failure can be caused by autoimmune hepatitis — a disease in which your immune system attacks liver cells, causing inflammation and injury.

Diseases of the veins in the liver.

Vascular diseases, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, can cause blockages in the veins of the liver and lead to acute liver failure.

Metabolic disease.

Rare metabolic diseases, such as Wilson''s disease and acute fatty liver of pregnancy, infrequently cause acute liver failure.

Cancer.

Cancer that either begins in or spreads to your liver can cause your liver to fail.

Shock.

Overwhelming infection (sepsis) and shock can severely reduce blood flow to the liver, causing liver failure.

Heat stroke.

Extreme physical activity in a hot environment can trigger acute liver failure.

Some cases of acute liver failure have no obvious cause.',NULL,'Associated Procedures

Too much fluid in the brain (cerebral edema).

Too much fluid causes pressure to build up in your brain, which can lead to disorientation, severe mental confusion and seizures.

Bleeding and bleeding disorders.

A failing liver cannot make enough clotting factors, which help blood to clot. Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is common with this condition. It may be difficult to control.

Infections.

People with acute liver failure are more likely to develop infections, particularly in the blood and in the respiratory and urinary tracts.

Kidney failure.

Kidney failure often occurs after liver failure, especially if you had an acetaminophen overdose, which damages both your liver and your kidneys.','Reduce your risk of acute liver failure by taking care of your liver.

Follow instructions on medications.

If you take acetaminophen or other medications, check the package insert for the recommended dosage, and don''t take more than that. If you already have liver disease, ask your health care provider if it is safe to take any amount of acetaminophen.

Tell your provider about all your medicines.

Even over-the-counter and herbal medicines can interfere with prescription drugs you''re taking.

Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all.

If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.

Avoid risky behavior.

Get help if you use illicit intravenous drugs. Don''t share needles. Use condoms during sex. If you get tattoos or body piercings, make sure the shop you choose is clean and safe. Don''t smoke.

Get vaccinated.

If you have chronic liver disease, a history of any type of hepatitis infection or an increased risk of hepatitis, talk to your provider about getting the hepatitis B vaccine. A vaccine also is available for hepatitis A.

Avoid contact with other people''s blood and body fluids.

Accidental needle sticks or improper cleanup of blood or body fluids can spread hepatitis viruses. Sharing razor blades or toothbrushes also can spread infection.

Don''t eat wild mushrooms.

It can be difficult to tell the difference between a poisonous mushroom and one that is safe to eat.

Take care with aerosol sprays.

When you use an aerosol cleaner, make sure the room is ventilated, or wear a mask. Take similar protective measures when spraying insecticides, fungicides, paint and other toxic chemicals. Follow product instructions carefully.

Watch what gets on your skin.

When using insecticides and other toxic chemicals, cover your skin with gloves, long sleeves, a hat and a mask.

Maintain a healthy weight.

Obesity can cause a condition called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which may include fatty liver, hepatitis and cirrhosis.',NULL);

Adrenal glands

Adrenal glands

Located on top of each kidney, the adrenal glands make hormones that help regulate metabolism, the immune system, blood pressure and other important functions. Although small, these glands control much of what happens in the body.

Addison''s disease is caused by damage to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands sit just above the kidneys. As part of the endocrine system, they make hormones that affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Damage to these glands results in too little of the hormone cortisol and, often, the hormone aldosterone.

The adrenal glands are made up of two sections. The interior, called the medulla, makes adrenaline-like hormones. The outer layer, called the cortex, makes a group of hormones called corticosteroids. Corticosteroids include:

Glucocorticoids.

These hormones, including cortisol, affect the body''s ability to turn food into energy. They also play a role in the immune system''s inflammatory response and help the body respond to stress.

Mineralocorticoids.

These hormones, including aldosterone, balance the body''s sodium and potassium to keep blood pressure in a healthy range.

Androgens.

In all people, the adrenal glands make small amounts of these sex hormones. They cause male sexual development. And they affect muscle mass, sex drive, known as libido, and a sense of well-being in all people.

Primary adrenal insufficiency

Sometimes, the outer layer of the adrenal glands, known as the cortex, is damaged. Then it can''t make enough hormones, a condition called primary adrenal insufficiency. This is usually the result of an autoimmune disease, in which the body attacks itself. People with Addison''s disease are more likely than are other people to have another autoimmune disease as well.

Other causes of adrenal gland failure may include:

Tuberculosis

Other infections of the adrenal glands

Spread of cancer to the adrenal glands

Bleeding into the adrenal glands

Secondary adrenal insufficiency

The pituitary gland makes a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).

ACTH

in turn causes the adrenal cortex to make its hormones. Having pituitary tumors that aren''t cancer, inflammation and pituitary surgery can cause the pituitary gland to make too little

ACTH

.

Too little

ACTH

can cause the adrenal glands to make too little glucocorticoids and androgens. This is called secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Most symptoms of secondary adrenal insufficiency are similar to those of primary adrenal insufficiency. However, people with secondary adrenal insufficiency don''t have darkened skin and are less likely to have severe dehydration or low blood pressure. They''re more likely to have low blood sugar.

A temporary cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when people who take corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to treat conditions such as asthma or arthritis, stop taking the medicine suddenly rather than tapering off.',NULL,'Adrenal fatigue: What causes it?

If you have untreated Addison''s disease, you may develop an addisonian crisis as a result of stress on the body, such as injury, infection or illness. Typically, the adrenal glands make two or three times the usual amount of cortisol in response to physical stress. With adrenal insufficiency, not being able to increase the amount of cortisol made as a result of stress can lead to an addisonian crisis.

An addisonian crisis is a life-threatening situation that results in low blood pressure, low blood levels of sugar and high blood levels of potassium. It requires immediate medical care.

Other autoimmune diseases.

People with Addison''s disease often have related autoimmune diseases.','Addison''s disease can''t be prevented, but there are ways to avoid an addisonian crisis:

Talk to your health care provider if you always feel tired or weak or are losing weight without trying. Ask about an adrenal shortage.

If you have been diagnosed with Addison''s disease, ask your provider what to do when you''re sick. You may need to learn how to increase your dose of corticosteroids.

If you become very sick, especially if you are vomiting and you can''t take your medicine, go to an emergency room.

Some people with Addison''s disease worry about serious side effects from hydrocortisone or prednisone. However, people with Addison''s disease aren''t as likely to get the side effects of high-dose glucocorticoids. That''s because the dose prescribed replaces the amount that''s missing.

If you take cortisone, be sure to follow up with your provider regularly to make sure your dose is not too high.',NULL);

Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Raising a Healthy Child','The primary features of

ADHD

include inattention and hyperactive-impulsive behavior.

ADHD

symptoms start before age 12, and in some children, they''re noticeable as early as 3 years of age.

ADHD

symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe, and they may continue into adulthood.

ADHD

occurs more often in males than in females, and behaviors can be different in boys and girls. For example, boys may be more hyperactive and girls may tend to be quietly inattentive.

There are three subtypes of

ADHD

:

Predominantly inattentive.

The majority of symptoms fall under inattention.

Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive.

The majority of symptoms are hyperactive and impulsive.

Combined.

This is a mix of inattentive symptoms and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms.

Inattention

A child who shows a pattern of inattention may often:

Fail to pay close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork

Have trouble staying focused in tasks or play

Appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly

Have difficulty following through on instructions and fail to finish schoolwork or chores

Have trouble organizing tasks and activities

Avoid or dislike tasks that require focused mental effort, such as homework

Lose items needed for tasks or activities, for example, toys, school assignments, pencils

Be easily distracted

Forget to do some daily activities, such as forgetting to do chores

Hyperactivity and impulsivity

A child who shows a pattern of hyperactive and impulsive symptoms may often:

Fidget with or tap his or her hands or feet, or squirm in the seat

Have difficulty staying seated in the classroom or in other situations

Be on the go, in constant motion

Run around or climb in situations when it''s not appropriate

Have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly

Talk too much

Blurt out answers, interrupting the questioner

Have difficulty waiting for his or her turn

Interrupt or intrude on others'' conversations, games or activities

Typical developmental behavior vs. ADHD

Most healthy children are inattentive, hyperactive or impulsive at one time or another. It''s typical for preschoolers to have short attention spans and be unable to stick with one activity for long. Even in older children and teenagers, attention span often depends on the level of interest.

The same is true of hyperactivity. Young children are naturally energetic — they often are still full of energy long after they''ve worn their parents out. In addition, some children just naturally have a higher activity level than others do. Children should never be classified as having

ADHD

just because they''re different from their friends or siblings.

Children who have problems in school but get along well at home or with friends are likely struggling with something other than

ADHD

. The same is true of children who are hyperactive or inattentive at home, but whose schoolwork and friendships remain unaffected.

When to see a doctor

If you''re concerned that your child shows signs of

ADHD

, see your pediatrician or family doctor. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, such as a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, psychologist, psychiatrist or pediatric neurologist, but it''s important to have a medical evaluation first to check for other possible causes of your child''s difficulties.

Adjustment disorders affect how you feel and think about yourself and the world. They also may affect your actions or behavior.

Some examples include:

Feeling sad, hopeless or not enjoying things you used to enjoy.

Crying often.

Worrying, or feeling anxious, nervous, jittery or stressed out.

Feeling irritable or like you can''t handle anything and don''t know where to start.

Having trouble sleeping.

Not eating enough.

Having difficulty concentrating.

Having difficulty with daily activities.

Withdrawing from family and friends who support you socially.

Not doing important things, such as going to work or paying bills.

Thinking about suicide or acting on those thoughts.

Symptoms of an adjustment disorder start within three months of a stressful event. These symptoms last no longer than six months after the end of the stressful event. But constant or lasting adjustment disorders can continue for more than six months. This is especially true if the stressful event is ongoing, such as being unemployed.

When to see a doctor

Stressors are usually temporary. You learn to cope with them over time. Symptoms of adjustment disorder usually get better when the stress eases. But sometimes the stressful event continues to be a part of your life. Or a new stressful situation comes up, and you face the same emotional struggles all over again.

Talk to your doctor or a mental health professional if you continue to struggle or if you''re having trouble getting through each day. You can get treatment to help you cope better with stressful events and feel better about life again.

If you have concerns about your child''s behavior, talk with your child''s doctor.

Suicidal thoughts or behavior

The risk of suicide can be higher in people who have adjustment disorders. If you''re thinking about suicide, contact a hotline for counseling:

Adrenal glands

Adrenal glands

Located on top of each kidney, the adrenal glands make hormones that help regulate metabolism, the immune system, blood pressure and other important functions. Although small, these glands control much of what happens in the body.

Adrenal cancer is a rare cancer that begins in one or both of the small, triangular glands (adrenal glands) located on top of your kidneys. Adrenal glands produce hormones that give instructions to virtually every organ and tissue in your body.

Adrenal cancer, also called adrenocortical cancer, can occur at any age. But it''s most likely to affect children younger than 5 and adults in their 40s and 50s.

When adrenal cancer is found early, there is a chance for cure. But if the cancer has spread to areas beyond the adrenal glands, cure becomes less likely. Treatment can be used to delay progression or recurrence.

Most growths that form in the adrenal glands are noncancerous (benign). Benign adrenal tumors, such as adenoma or pheochromocytoma, also can develop in the adrenal glands.

Adrenal cancer forms when something creates changes (mutations) in the DNA of an adrenal gland cell. A cell''s DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutations can tell the cell to multiply uncontrollably and to continue living when healthy cells would die. When this happens, the abnormal cells accumulate and form a tumor. The tumor cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body.','Adrenal cancer happens more often in people with inherited syndromes that increase the risk of certain cancers.

Chambers and valves of the heart

Chambers and valves of the heart

A typical heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.

Researchers aren''t sure what causes most types of congenital heart disease. Some congenital heart diseases are passed down through families (inherited).

To understand congenital heart disease, it helps to know how the heart typically works.

The heart is divided into chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).

The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through blood vessels (pulmonary arteries).

In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and then returns to the left side of your heart through the pulmonary veins.

The left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the aorta and out to the rest of the body.

Congenital heart disease can affect any of these heart structures, including the arteries, valves, chambers and the wall of tissue that separates the chambers (septum).','Certain environmental and genetic risk factors might play a role in the development of congenital heart disease, including:

Genetics.

Congenital heart disease appears to run in families (inherited). It''s associated with many genetic syndromes. For instance, children with Down syndrome often have congenital heart defects. Genetic testing can detect Down syndrome and some other genetic conditions while a baby is still in the mother''s womb.

German measles (rubella).

Having rubella during pregnancy may affect how the baby''s heart develops while in the womb.

Diabetes.

Having type 1 or type 2 diabetes during pregnancy also may affect a baby''s heart development. Gestational diabetes generally doesn''t increase the risk of congenital heart disease.

Medications.

Taking certain medications while pregnant can cause congenital heart disease and other birth defects. Medications linked to heart defects include lithium for bipolar disorder and isotretinoin (Claravis, Myorisan, others), which is used to treat acne. Always tell your health care provider about the medications you take.

Alcohol.

Drinking alcohol while pregnant has been linked to an increased risk of heart defects in the baby.

Smoking.

If you smoke, quit. Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital heart defects in the baby.','Infographic: Congenital Heart Disease and Lifelong Care

Complications of congenital heart disease in adults include:

Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias).

Faulty heart signaling causes the heart to beat too fast, too slowly or irregularly. In some people, severe arrhythmias may cause stroke or sudden cardiac death if not treated. Scar tissue in the heart from previous surgeries can contribute to this complication.

Heart infection (endocarditis).

Bacteria or other germs can enter the bloodstream and move to the inner lining of the heart (endocardium). Untreated, this infection can damage or destroy the heart valves or cause a stroke. If you are at high risk of endocarditis, your care provider may recommend taking antibiotics one hour before dental cleanings. Regular dental checkups are important. Healthy gums and teeth reduce the risk that bacteria will enter the bloodstream.

Stroke.

A congenital heart defect can allow a blood clot to pass through the heart and travel to the brain, where it reduces or blocks blood supply.

High blood pressure in the lung arteries (pulmonary hypertension).

Some congenital heart defects send more blood to the lungs, causing pressure to build. This eventually causes the heart muscle to weaken and sometimes to fail.

Heart failure.

Heart failure (congestive heart failure) means the heart can''t pump enough blood to meet the body''s needs.

Adult congenital heart disease and pregnancy

It may be possible to have a successful pregnancy with mild congenital heart disease. A care provider may tell you not to get pregnant if you have a complex congenital heart defect.

Before becoming pregnant, talk to your health care provider about the possible risks and complications. Together you can discuss and plan for any special care needed during pregnancy.','Some types of congenital heart disease occur in families (inherited). If you have or someone in your family has congenital heart disease, screening by a genetic counselor may help determine the risk of certain heart defects in future children.','Atrial septal defect (ASD)

Fever.

Fever may rise to at least 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius). The fever may spike once or twice a day for a week or longer.

Rash.

A rash might come and go with the fever. The rash usually appears on the trunk, arms or legs.

Sore throat.

This is one of the first symptoms of adult Still disease. The lymph nodes in the neck might be swollen and tender.

Achy and swollen joints.

Joints — especially in the knees and wrists— might be stiff, painful and inflamed. Ankles, elbows, hands and shoulders also might ache. The joint discomfort usually lasts at least two weeks.

Muscle pain.

Muscular pain usually comes and goes with the fever. The pain can be severe enough to disrupt daily activities.

Symptoms of this disorder can differ from person to person. They can mimic those of other conditions, including lupus and a type of cancer called lymphoma.

When to see a doctor

If you have a high fever, rash and achy joints, see your health care provider. Also, if you have adult Still disease and develop a cough, difficulty breathing, chest pain or any other symptoms that are not usual, call your health care provider.

The chronic swelling and irritation that occurs with adult Still disease can damage the joints. The most commonly involved joints are the knees and wrists. Sometimes other joints, including the neck, foot, finger and hip joints, also are affected.

Inflammation of the heart.

Adult Still disease can inflame the saclike covering of the heart, called the pericardium. This results in inflammation of the pericardium, called pericarditis. The disease can also inflame the muscular part of the heart, called the myocardium. This results in inflammation of the myocardium, called myocarditis.

Excess fluid around the lungs.

Inflammation may cause fluid to build up around the lungs. When this happens, it can be hard to take deep breaths.

INSERT INTO mytable(Overview,Symptoms,Causes,Risk_factors,Related,Name,Complications,Prevention,Types) VALUES ('Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder. Agoraphobia involves fearing and avoiding places or situations that might cause panic and feelings of being trapped, helpless or embarrassed. You may fear an actual or upcoming situation. For example, you may fear using public transportation, being in open or enclosed spaces, standing in line, or being in a crowd.

The anxiety is caused by fear that there''s no easy way to escape or get help if the anxiety gets overwhelming. You may avoid situations because of fears such as getting lost, falling, or having diarrhea and not being able to get to a bathroom. Most people who have agoraphobia develop it after having one or more panic attacks, causing them to worry about having another attack. They then avoid the places where it may happen again.

Agoraphobia often results in having a hard time feeling safe in any public place, especially where crowds gather and in locations that are not familiar. You may feel that you need a companion, such as a family member or friend, to go with you to public places. The fear can be so overwhelming that you may feel you can''t leave your home.

Agoraphobia treatment can be challenging because it means confronting your fears. But with proper treatment — usually a form of therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy and medicines — you can escape the trap of agoraphobia and live a more enjoyable life.

Leaving home alone.

Crowds or waiting in line.

Enclosed spaces, such as movie theaters, elevators or small stores.

Open spaces, such as parking lots, bridges or malls.

Using public transportation, such as a bus, plane or train.

These situations cause anxiety because you fear you won''t be able to escape or find help if you start to feel panicked. Or you may fear having other disabling or embarrassing symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, falling or diarrhea.

In addition:

Your fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger of the situation.

You avoid the situation, you need a companion to go with you, or you endure the situation but are extremely upset.

You have major distress or problems with social situations, work or other areas in your life because of the fear, anxiety or avoidance.

Your fear and avoidance usually lasts six months or longer.

Panic disorder and agoraphobia

Some people have panic disorder in addition to agoraphobia. Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder that includes panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden feeling of extreme fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes and triggers a variety of intense physical symptoms. You might think that you''re totally losing control, having a heart attack or even dying.

Fear of another panic attack can lead to avoiding similar situations or the place where it happened in an attempt to prevent future panic attacks.

Symptoms of a panic attack can include:

Rapid heart rate.

Trouble breathing or a feeling of choking.

Chest pain or pressure.

Lightheadedness or dizziness.

Feeling shaky, numb or tingling.

Sweating too much.

Sudden flushing or chills.

Upset stomach or diarrhea.

Feeling a loss of control.

Fear of dying.

When to see a doctor

Agoraphobia can severely limit your ability to socialize, work, attend important events and even manage the details of daily life, such as running errands.

Don''t let agoraphobia make your world smaller. Call your health care provider or a mental health professional if you have symptoms of agoraphobia or panic attacks.

If this is too hard to do on your own, ask a family member or friend to go with you, or seek professional help.

OCA

is a group of disorders passed down in families where the body makes little or none of a substance called melanin. The type and amount of melanin in your body determines the color of your skin, hair and eyes. Melanin also plays a role in the development and function of the eyes, so people with albinism have vision problems.

Symptoms of albinism are usually seen in a person''s skin, hair and eye color, but sometimes differences are slight. People with albinism are also sensitive to the effects of the sun, so they''re at higher risk of getting skin cancer.

Although there''s no cure for albinism, people with the disorder can take steps to protect their skin and eyes and get proper eye and skin care.

Show more products from Mayo Clinic','Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision.

Skin

The easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism.

With exposure to the sun, some people may develop:

Freckles.

Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink.

Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez).

Sunburn and no ability to tan.

For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color.

Hair

Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that''s yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age.

Eye color

Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age.

With albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don''t have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting.

Vision

Vision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include:

Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can''t be controlled, called nystagmus.

An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better.

Eyes that can''t look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus.

Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness.

Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia.

A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision.

Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision.

Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don''t follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve.

Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is.

Legal blindness — vision less than 20/200 — or complete blindness.

When to see a doctor

At your child''s birth, the health care provider may notice a lack of color in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows. The provider will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your child''s skin color and vision.

If you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your health care provider.

Contact your health care provider if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising or long-term infections. These symptoms may suggest rare but serious hereditary conditions that include albinism.

Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern

Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern

To have an autosomal recessive disorder, you inherit two changed genes, sometimes called mutations. You get one from each parent. Their health is rarely affected because they have only one changed gene. Two carriers have a 25% chance of having an unaffected child with two unaffected genes. They have a 50% chance of having an unaffected child who also is a carrier. They have a 25% chance of having an affected child with two changed genes.

Several genes give instructions for making one of several proteins involved in producing melanin. Melanin is made by cells called melanocytes that are found in your skin, hair and eyes.

Albinism is caused by a change in one of these genes. Different types of albinism can occur, based mainly on which gene change caused the disorder. The gene change may result in no melanin at all or a big decrease in the amount of melanin.

Types of albinism

Types of albinism are grouped based on how they''re passed down in families and on the gene that is affected.

Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA),

the most common type, means a person gets two copies of a changed gene — one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance.

OCA

is the result of a change in one of eight genes, labeled from

OCA1

to

OCA8

.

OCA

causes decreased pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, as well as vision problems. The amount of pigment varies by type. The resulting color of skin, hair and eyes also varies by and within types.

Ocular albinism

is mainly limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of ocular albinism is type 1. This type is passed down by a gene change on the X chromosome. X-linked ocular albinism can be passed on by a mother who carries one changed X gene to her son. This is called X-linked recessive inheritance. Ocular albinism usually occurs only in males. It''s much less common than

OCA

.

Albinism related to rare hereditary syndromes

can occur. For example, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome includes a form of

OCA

, as well as bleeding and bruising problems and lung and bowel diseases. Chediak-Higashi syndrome includes a form of

OCA

, as well as immune problems with recurrent infections, problems with the brain and nerves, bleeding disorders, and other serious issues.',NULL,'Products & Services

Eye complications

Problems with vision can impact learning, employment and the ability to drive.

Skin complications

People with albinism have skin that is very sensitive to light and sun. Sunburn is one of the most serious complications of albinism. Sun exposure can cause sun damage, which may result in rough and thickened skin. Sunburn also can increase the risk of developing skin cancer.

Because of the lack of skin pigment, a type of skin cancer called melanoma may appear as pink or red growths or moles, rather than the usual black or brown color. This can make skin cancer harder to identify at an early stage. Without careful and regular skin exams, melanoma may not be diagnosed until it''s advanced.

Social and emotional challenges

Some people with albinism may experience discrimination. The reactions of other people to those with albinism can have a negative impact on people with the condition.

People with albinism may experience bullying, teasing or unwanted questions about their appearance, eyewear or visual aid tools. They may look different from members of their own families or ethnic groups, so they may feel like outsiders or be treated like outsiders. These experiences may cause social isolation, poor self-esteem and stress.

Using the term "person with albinism" is preferred to avoid the negative impact of other terms.','If a family member has albinism, a genetic counselor can help you understand the type of albinism and the chances of having a future child with albinism.
